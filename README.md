Battlefleet
===========

Tactical sci-fi space battles

Based on Warhammer 40000's Battlefleet Gothica boardgame and Rogue Trader RPG.
Also draws inspiration from Star Wars X-Wing miniatures game and Final Fantasy Tactics.

Planned Features:
-ship rotation (click and drag or keystrokes)
-ship movement (grid of legal moves should follow ship position and rotation, and only show up during movement phase)
-attack grid
-gui (for ship stats and list of moves)
-procedural gridspace (to simulate the vastness of space, there should be no 'borders' to a space battle)
